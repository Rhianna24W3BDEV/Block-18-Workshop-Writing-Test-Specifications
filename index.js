// A functiom called "multiplication" that returns the product of the two input numbers.

/*
Expect multiplication (5,10) to be a number
Expect multiplication (5,10) to equal 50
Expect multiplication (c,a) to be an error
*/

//A function called "concatOdds" takes two arrays of integers as arguments. 
//It should return a single array that only contains the odd numbers, in ascending order, from both of the arrays.

/*
Expect concatOdds ([3, 2, 1], [9, 1, 1, 1, 4, 15, -1]) to result in [-1, 1, 3, 9, 15]
Expect concatOdds ([3, 2, 1], [9, 1, 1, 1, 4, 15, -1]) to show mulitples of the same number 
Expect concatOdds ([3, 2, 1], [9, 1, 1, 1, 4, 15, -1]) to show numbers that arent odds like 2 and 4
Expect concatOdds ([3, 2, 1], [9, 1, 1, 1, 4, 15, -1]) to only show one of the same number
Expect concatOdds ([a, 2, d], [e, d, d, d, 4, f, g]) to be an error
